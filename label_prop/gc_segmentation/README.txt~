Run the segment_fb script to segment the image into background and foreground.


The scripts asks two from user two inputs. The foreground region is selected
from the original image. A mixture of Gaussian model is fitted on the rgb pixels
values in the selected foreground region. This model gives us the likelihood
distribution of a pixel belonging to the foreground. Another mixture of Gaussian is
fitted on the selected background region to model the likelihood distribution of
a pixel belonging to the background. The likelihood maps are shown in the report.pdf
for each of the input images. For the graph cut algorithm, we take the negative
log likelihood of the each map. This assumes that the data term in the energy function
is modeled as negative log likelihood ratio of the foreground and the background for
each pixel. The foreground segment boundary overlaid on the image when we take
constant pairwise term.
